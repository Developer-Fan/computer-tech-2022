# Journey Planner
### Description
This is a simple python tool to help you effectively plan journies.
It considers all aspects of the journey, including the weather, the distance, and it includes over 7 different modes of transport to choose from.
It also helps you find the optimal mode of transport for your journey, based on the distance and the weather, and can tell you how long it will take you to get to your destination based on the distance and the average speed of the transport.
Another great feature is that it allows you to save your journies for archiving past journies or preparing for future ones.
